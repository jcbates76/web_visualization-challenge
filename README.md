Web Visualization Challenge

## This project creates visualizations to explore the microbes that colonize human navels.  

1. Use the D4 library to read in samples.json.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.  Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.   

Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
